# FLY: On-the-Fly Programming {#fly}

## `biz.dev`: software business development methodology:

* don't stuck on thinking:
    * 80/20, draft coding for money
    * if you don't write code like a bot, and need thinking, you are doing something wrong
    * sight-read and go: if something not works, leave it for the next time
* don't stuck on tooling:
    * need much more copypasta + minimal codegen is enough
    * tooling needs learning: hand-hack and drop it done
* don't spread on platforms and languages
    * use only top-3 production languages (Python, Java, Erlang/Elixir)
    * only bare top frameworks (Django, Android, Web)
* FLY: code like a fly and buzz away
    * NO any hacks, custom components or tunings, only generic components
    * all code must be copypasted from tutorials and publics
    * no documenting or vendor training: everything is documented in tutorials, see in Google
* out of orders: polish your copypasta bin and codegen automation
    * scan fast across tutorials and books: be in theme but don't fix on topics
    * code snippets are fastest to use /`meld`-like tools/
    * parametric code templating: can be effective but needs too large efforts to implement
* metaprogramming: don't! #metaL and #Lisp
    * the problem is metasystem complexity rises much more faster than target application code
* modifying software is easy
    * any system must be rewritten few times by adapting it from drafts to real needs
    * the working draft can be enough even before the MVP shows itself ready
    * customer requirements always change faster than your progress, does not matter how you are sparks



As soon as I stop to think about the code and architecture, everything became
clear, and I become to write any service like a demon.

*On-the-fly programming* is a style of programming in which the
programmer/performer/composer augments and modifies the program while it is
running, without stopping or restarting, in order to assert expressive,
programmable control at runtime.
